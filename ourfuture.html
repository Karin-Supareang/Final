                        Mika is a former member of the Tea Party and is also a childhood friend of its leader, Nagisa.
                        However,

                        public and private lives.
                        Mika always presents a happy smile and innocent appearance, but she seems to be troubled by
                        something she's unable to confide in others.</p>
